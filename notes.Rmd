```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is what worked for me on Windows 10 as of May 2018 with the latest installs of all these packages if it doesn't "just work" after following the [rticles install instructions](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) (so you may not have to do this). 

#### 1 Install some R packages
```{r}
#Install rticles
#install.packages("rticles", type = "source")
library(rticles)
#install.packages("here") # for relative file paths to this R Project
library(here)

#install.packages("tinytex") 
#Prompted by initial error "You are recommended to install the tinytex package to build PDF.FALSE Error: Failed to compile elvesier_test.tex."
library(tinytex)

library(rmarkdown) # render function below requires loading this
```

Note that code below is functionally equivilent to pressing the **knit** button, but probably won't work yet if MikTeX is not installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
render(here("elvesier_test", "elvesier_test.Rmd"))
```


#### 2 Install MikTeK

https://miktex.org/download

To mamage your settings with MikTeX, open the newly-installed MikTeX Console, and 
    - Under Settings --> General, select " Always install missing packages on-the-fly"
    - Under Settings --> Directories, copy the file path for "Links to the executables have been installed in", which might look like `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX 2.9`

Still got "pdflatex not found" error when compiling .tex file on knit, and indeed the environment variable is not set:

```{r}
Sys.which("pdflatex")
pdflatex 
#Source: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/398218/pdflatex-not-found-windows
```

#### 3 Create and edit .Renviron file to provide path to pdflatex.exe in the MiKTeX directory listed above
```{r}
#to programmatically create an Renviron file, uncomment lines below (commented out for knit)
#install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
#usethis::edit_r_environ("rticles_test") # This creates an .Renviron file
```

Now, edit the .Renviron file to contain this exactly as written (adjust for your file path as needed) and save it
```
#pdflatex
PATH=C:\\Users\\Dana\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin\\x64;"${PATH}"
```

#### 4 knit the .Rmd file to a PDF!

If you experience an error like this:
"Error in tools::file_path_as_absolute(output_file)"
it may be resolved by changing the miktex settings to install required packages automatically on the fly.
