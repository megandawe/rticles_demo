```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is what worked for me on Windows 10 as of May 2018 with the latest installs of all these packages if it doesn't "just work" after following the [rticles install instructions](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) (so you may not have to do this). 

* For Mac users, go to bottom of page of initial install.packages() does not flawlessly compile a PDF. This is woth worked for me as of June 2018 with the latest installs of R and rticles, running on macOS High Sierra (10.13). 

FOR WINDOWS:

#### 1 Install some R packages
```{r}
#Install rticles
#install.packages("rticles", type = "source")
library(rticles)
#install.packages("here") # for relative file paths to this R Project
library(here)

#install.packages("tinytex") 
#Prompted by initial error "You are recommended to install the tinytex package to build PDF.FALSE Error: Failed to compile elvesier_test.tex."
library(tinytex)

library(rmarkdown) # render function below requires loading this
```

Note that code below is functionally equivilent to pressing the **knit** button, but probably won't work yet if MikTeX is not installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
render(here("elvesier_test", "elvesier_test.Rmd"))
```


#### 2 Install MikTeK

https://miktex.org/download

To mamage your settings with MikTeX, open the newly-installed MikTeX Console, and 
    - Under Settings --> General, select " Always install missing packages on-the-fly"
    - Under Settings --> Directories, copy the file path for "Links to the executables have been installed in", which might look like `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX 2.9`

Still got "pdflatex not found" error when compiling .tex file on knit, and indeed the environment variable is not set:

```{r}
Sys.which("pdflatex")
pdflatex 
#Source: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/398218/pdflatex-not-found-windows
```

#### 3 Create and edit .Renviron file to provide path to pdflatex.exe in the MiKTeX directory listed above
```{r}
#to programmatically create an Renviron file, uncomment lines below (commented out for knit)
#install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
#usethis::edit_r_environ("rticles_test") # This creates an .Renviron file
```

Now, edit the .Renviron file to contain this exactly as written (adjust for your file path as needed) and save it
```
#pdflatex
PATH=C:\\Users\\Dana\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\MiKTeX 2.9\\miktex\\bin\\x64;"${PATH}"
```

#### 4 knit the .Rmd file to a PDF!

If you experience an error like this:
"Error in tools::file_path_as_absolute(output_file)"
it may be resolved by changing the miktex settings to install required packages automatically on the fly.

FOR MAC:

#### 1 Install some R packages
```{r}
#Install rticles
#install.packages("rticles", type = "source")
```
If after installing this, try to knit to PDF:
1. File -> New File -> New RMarkdown
2. Choose "From Template", select any template you'd like
3. Knit

My file was able to be compile to .rmd, but was not able to be translated to .tex
I received the error "no TeX installation detected. please install TeX before compiling"


#### 2 Install MacTeX (Mac version of MikTeK)

https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html

Download and install the latest MacTeX. Restart RStudio (I restarted my entire system). 
Open a new RMarkdown from a template (same steps as above). 
Knit
