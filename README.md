# rticles_demo
Example of creating PDFs in journal-specific formats from RMarkdown templates provided with the [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package from Rstudio

**This repository contains:**

- `notes.Rmd` - instructions on one way of installing `rticles` and configuring it with MiKTeX on Windows 10.
    - .`Renviron` is one of the files created by this setup  
    
    
- *plos_test* - repository containing an RMarkdown template, associated files, and a PDF file created from the .Rmd file. 
    - The files automatically created for the *PLOS* template from `rticles` are below. In general you won't have to worry about editing these files by hand, but don't delete them either since some are required for the .Rmd --> .md --> .TeX --> .pdf conversion to work correctly.  
    
        - plos_test.Rmd - the main RMarkdown file to be knit
        - PLOS-submission.eps - this is the logo
        - PLOS-submission-eps-converted-to.pdf - logo in pdf format
        - mybibfile.bib - this is where the references go
        - plos.csl 
        
        
 - The output files of knitting the .Rmd file are:
        - plos_test.tex
        - plos_test.pdf

            
- *elsevier_test* - repository containing an RMarkdown template, associated files, and a PDF file created from the .Rmd file. 
    - The files automatically created for the *Elsevier* template from `rticles` are below. In general you also won't have to worry about editing these files by hand, but some are required for the .Rmd --> .md --> .TeX --> .pdf conversion to work correctly. 
    
        - elsevier_test.Rmd - the main RMarkdown file to be knit
        - skeleton.tex - example included with repo
        - skeleton.pdf - example included with repo
        - numcompress.sty
        - mybibfile.bib - this is where the references go
        - elsearticle.cls 

    - The output files of knitting the .Rmd file are:
        - elsevier_test.tex
        - elsevier_test.pdf
        - elsevier_test.spl (Windows spool file?)
